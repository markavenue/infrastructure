# Mark Avenue Infrastructure

This repository holds all code, configuration and documentation related to the infrastructure.

## Configuration

Currently, configuration is being done manually instead of using IaC, as the infrastructure is:

- Simple
- Not expected to change much, if at all
- Is maintained by a single person

Write-up of the configuration can be found in [configuration.md].

[configuration.md]: configuration.md
